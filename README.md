# Retail Analysis with Walmart Data

## Project Description
   * Performed EDA and used an ML algorithm(Linear Regression) that predicts demand accurately and ingests factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.
   
## Process
   * Statistical tasks
      * Found store with maximum sales
      * Found store that has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, found out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation
      * Finding store/s that has good quarterly growth rate in Q3’2012
      * Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Found out holidays which had higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together
      * Provided a monthly and semester view of sales in units and gave insights
   * Statistical Model
      * For Store 1 – Built a Linear Regression model to forecast demand
      * Linear Regression – Utilized variables like date and restructured dates as 1 for 5 Feb 2010 (starting from the earliest date in order). Hypothesized if CPI, unemployment, and fuel price have any impact on sales.
